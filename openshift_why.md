## Comparison between clusters that run in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and standard OCP
{: #compare_ocp}

Because {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} is a managed service, many of the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong}} components and global settings that you manually set up in OpenShift Container Platform are set up for you by default in {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}. Review the following differences between {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} clusters and a standard installation of OpenShift Container Platform on your own infrastructure. You can also review the [service architecture](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-service-arch) for an overview of how {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} components are set up in the cluster master and worker nodes, or the [global settings](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-service-settings#global-settings) that you can or cannot configure.
{: shortdesc}

<img src="images/icon-version-43.png" alt="Version 4 icon" width="30" style="width:30px; border-style: none"/> The following comparison applies to clusters that run {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} version 4. For version 3.11 clusters, the general principles are similar, such as that IBM provides a managed master, but the implementation details differ due to the changes in the underlying OCP version. For more information, see [Comparison between {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} 3.11 and 4 clusters](#3.11_vs_4.3).
{: note}

|Characteristics|Standard OCP|{{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}|
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cluster master (control plane) | You set up control plane components like the API server and etcd on machines that get the `master` role. You can modify the control plane components, but keep in mind that you are responsible for backing up, restoring, and making control plane data highly available. | IBM sets up the master, manages the control plane components, and automatically applies master patch updates for you. The masters are highly available and backed up automatically.|
| Compute machines (worker nodes) | You create your own compatible compute machines, set up compatible network connectivity, SSH into the machines, install OCP, and register the machines as worker nodes in the cluster. Your machines might be installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) for a guided setup, or user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) for more control and subsequent administration on your end. You are responsible for maintaining and updating the worker nodes. You can install updates from the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console. | You select the flavor of worker nodes that you want to add to your cluster, and IBM automatically connects the worker nodes to the cluster and installs OCP. In this sense, the installation is similar to IPI for you because you do not have to manage all of the infrastructure and network settings. IBM also provides patch updates that you can choose to apply to your worker nodes, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} interface (not the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console). SSH is disabled for added security. |
| OCP versions and patch updates | You are responsible for updating the underlying infrastructure for the master and worker nodes. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console to update OCP versions. | IBM automatically applies updates to the master, and provides version updates and security patch updates for the worker nodes. You choose when to apply these updates to your worker nodes, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} interface (not the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console). Supported versions might vary from standard OpenShift Container Platform.|
| Autoscaling compute machines | You can set up a `ClusterAutoscaler` resource. | You can set up the [cluster autoscaler plug-in](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ca). |
| Worker node operating system | CoreOS or RHEL. | RHEL 7. |
| Support | Provided per the terms of your Red Hat subscription or cloud provider. You can use the `oc adm must-gather` tool to help gather information. | Provided by [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/support){: external}. You can use the `oc adm must-gather` tool, or the [Diagnostics and Debug Tool](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-debug-tool) to help gather information. |
| {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console | You set up and can configure or disable the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console. | The {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} web console is set up for you. You cannot configure or disable the web console. IBM also provides the [{{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} clusters console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters?platformType=openshift){: external} to manage your cluster infrastructure. |
| Authentication | An OAuth server is provided, but you configure the token settings and identity provider to control access to the cluster. You also manage RBAC to control user access within the cluster. | IBM automatically sets up the OAuth server to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM. You cannot change the identity provider. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM is also set up to [automatically sync to RBAC](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-access_reference#service) so that you can use IAM to manage access to and within the cluster. |
| Container network for clusters | The cluster network operator sets up the SDN container network interface (CNI) plug-in. You can change the CNI plug-in, configure multiple networks, or attach a hardware network such as single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV). | Calico is set up for you. You cannot change the CNI plug-in, configure multiple networks, or attach a hardware network.|
| Ingress | You can use the Ingress operator to set up one or more HAProxy-based Ingress controllers. You can route traffic to your apps by specifying `Route` or `Ingress` resources. | When you create a cluster, a default Ingress subdomain is set up for you. One HAProxy-based router is set up for each Ingress controller, and one router service is automatically created in each zone that you have worker nodes in. You can route traffic to your apps by specifying `Route` or `Ingress` resources. For more information, see [About Ingress in {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} version 4](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ingress-about-roks4). |
| Storage | You must set up persistent volumes to be backed up by a storage provider. OpenShift Data Foundation is available. | IBM automatically sets up storage providers such as {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File and Block. OpenShift Data Foundation is not available. For supported storage options, see [Planning highly available persistent storage](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-storage_planning). |
| Image registry | The cluster is set up with an internal registry to pull images. If your cluster has public network acccess, you can pull images automatically from Docker Hub. To pull images from other registries, you must set up image pull secrets. You set up the internal registry to back up images to a cloud storage provider. Stored images are not available across clusters. | The internal registry is set up to back up images automatically to a bucket in your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance. Your cluster has image pull secrets automatically set up to pull images from default registries, including {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}. You can also set up the internal registry to work with {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, which your cluster is also automatically set up to pull images from. For more information, see [Setting up an image registry](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-registry). |
| Operators and OperatorHub | OpenShift Container Platform sets up many operators to manage default components for the cluster. You can also use the OperatorHub to install other operators such as from 3rd-party providers. | IBM sets up many of the same operators as OCP to manage default component for the cluster. However, because IBM manages the master and provides you with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} APIs to manage your cloud infrastructure, some operators, such as the machine set operator and other components as noted in this table, are not set up or configurable. You can also use the OperatorHub to [install other operators](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-operators) such as from 3rd-party providers. Note that operators that you install or create are not supported by IBM, and might come with their own support terms and pricing.|
| Projects, builds, and apps | OpenShift Container Platform provides tools such as projects, build configs, and the internal registry that you can use to deploy your apps while following a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) methodology. | {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} clusters come with all the same configurable project and build components as OCP clusters. You can also choose to integrate your cluster with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services like [{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cicd). |
| Cluster health | You can also set up logging, monitoring, and metering tools by installing and configuring various operators. These solutions are cluster-specific and not highly available unless you back them up. | Your clusters feature one-click integrations with {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} for enterprise-grade, persistent monitoring and logging solutions across clusters. You can also install the logging and monitoring operators as with standard OCP, but you might have to adjust the configuration settings. For more information, see [Logging and monitoring cluster health](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-health). |
| Migrating clusters | You can use the cluster migrator operator to migrate clusters from one major version to another. Migration requires separate clusters; you cannot update a cluster from one major version to another. Various open source tools might be used, but are not officially supported. | As with standard OpenShift Container Platform, you cannot update a cluster from one major version to another. If you use a third-party open source tool such as the [cluster migrator operator](https://github.com/konveyor/mig-operator){: external}, the tool is not supported by IBM and might have limitations such as the migration UI being unavailable. |
| Container-native virtualization | You can set up [container-native virtualization add-on](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/virt/about-virt.html){: external} on bare metal machines, but not on virtual machines.<p class="note">Container-native virtualization is not supported by IBM. If you experience issues, you are responsible for resolving the issues and any impact to your worklaods.</p>|
| Serverless workloads | You can set up [{{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} Serverless](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/serverless-getting-started.html){: external}. | You can also set up {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} Serverless. |
| Service mesh | You can set up the [Red Hat {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} Service Mesh](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/service_mesh/v1x/installing-ossm.html){: external}. | You can also set up the Red Hat {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} Service Mesh, but you must [apply a network policy](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kitch/39c504a2ed9e381c2aadea436d5b52e4/raw/d8efa69f41d41425b16bb363a881a98d40d3708c/mesh-policy.yaml){: external} for the service mesh ingress to work.|
| API and CLI tools | OpenShift Container Platform clusters are set up with access to Kubernetes and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} API resources. You can also install command line tools such as `oc` and `odo`. | {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} clusters come with the same capabilities to use the Kubernetes and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} API and CLI tools. Additionally, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [API](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_api_install) and [CLI](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli) tools to manage your cluster infrastructure and integrate other cloud services with your cluster.|
