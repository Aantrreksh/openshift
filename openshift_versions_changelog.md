# Version changelog
{: #openshift_changelog}

View information of version changes for major, minor, and patch updates that are available for your {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong}} clusters. Changes include updates to OpenShift, Kubernetes, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider components.
{:shortdesc}

Unless otherwise noted in the changelogs, the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provider version enables Kubernetes APIs and features that are at beta. Kubernetes alpha features, which are subject to change, are disabled.

Check the [Security Bulletins on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Status](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=security) for security vulnerabilities that affect Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. You can filter the results to view only OpenShift security bulletins that are relevant to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. Changelog entries that address other security vulnerabilities but do not also refer to an IBM Security Bulletin are for vulnerabilities that are not known to affect Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud in normal usage. If you run privileged containers, run commands on the workers, or execute untrusted code, then you might be at risk.

Master patch updates are applied automatically. Worker node patch updates can be applied by reloading or updating the worker nodes. For more information about major, minor, and patch versions and preparation actions between minor versions, see [OpenShift versions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
